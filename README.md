## Introduction

Music has always been a powerful form of artistic expression, and now, with the help of AI, we can explore entirely new frontiers of musical creativity. FacebookMusicGen is a state-of-the-art AI model that can generate unique and captivating music compositions. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for generating AI music compositions and securely storing them using blockchain technology.

## Technology Stack

- **FacebookMusicGen**: This AI model is the heart of our music generation system. It has been trained on a vast dataset of musical compositions and can create music in various styles and genres.

- **Hugging Face**: We use Hugging Face's model hosting capabilities to provide an API for interacting with FacebookMusicGen.

- **Next.js**: Our web application is built with Next.js, a React framework. It provides a smooth and responsive user interface for generating and exploring AI music compositions.

- **Near Blockchain**: Near is a blockchain platform that ensures secure and transparent storage of your music compositions. This technology is used to create a permanent and tamper-proof record of your musical creations.

- **Mintbase Library**: Mintbase is a library for minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Near blockchain. We use this library to mint and manage NFTs representing your AI-generated music.
